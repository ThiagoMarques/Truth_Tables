# Truth_Tables
Uma calculadora da tabela de verdade para lógica clássica.

Introduction
This truth-table calculator for classical logic shows, well, truth-tables for propositions of classical logic. Featuring a purple munster and a duck, and optionally showing intermediate results, it is one of the better instances of its kind.

Use the buttons below (or your keyboard) to enter a proposition, then gently touch the duck to have it calculate the truth-table for you. The friendly monster to the duck's left will eat up a character (or, if there is selected text, the whole selection) each time you touch it. If you double-click the monster, it will eat up the whole input (yum!).

Once the table is there, use the button "Show intermediate results" or "Hide intermediate results" to show or hide intermediate results in the table.

See a few examples below. Clicking on an example will copy it to the input field. Alternatively, you may leave the input field completely empty. On touching the duck, its psychic personality will find out what proposition you are thinking of (this is an experimental feature).

(P→Q) — (P∧Q) — (P∨Q) — (P∨¬P) — (P∧¬P) — (P→((Q→R)∧(¬S∨R))) — (P→Q)∨(Q→R)

If you prefer using your keyboard, you may use the strings "&" or "&&" to denote "∧"; the strings "|" or "||" to denote "∨"; the strings "=>" or "->" to denote "→"; the string "<=>" or "<->" to denote "↔"; and the strings "!" or "~" to denote "¬".

The tables are calculated in your browser, so the calculator is available offline, and the government won't ever find out what propositions you are working with (unless they hack your computer).
